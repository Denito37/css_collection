                    Each page is dedicated to a common component in nearly all applications
                    so that if you struggle with one you can get the help
                    you want. I recommend copying the CSS into your projects
                    & play with the values to see how they affect your component.
                    Doing this will increase your understanding of how each element property 
                    affects your component.
