            Currently CSS is my favorite part of the web development 
            process so I thought that making a site that showcases all
            the small but cool things u can do with CSS to elevate the 
            experience of using a website. Also I can continue to add 
            to this site as I get more experience with CSS making it a
            great way to keep track of my progress
