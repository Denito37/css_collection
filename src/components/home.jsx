            CSS is my favorite part of the web development process 
            so I thought that making a site that showcases a lot of
            the small but cool things u can do with CSS to elevate the 
            experience of using a website would be a good use of my time.
            Also I plan to continue to add to this site as I get more 
            experience with CSS.
